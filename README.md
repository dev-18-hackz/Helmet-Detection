# 🪖 Helmet Detection using CNN & ResNet50

## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on detecting whether a person is wearing a helmet using deep learning techniques. It utilizes both a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a pre-trained ResNet50 model to classify images into **Helmet** and **No Helmet** categories. The system is designed for applications in traffic surveillance and road safety enforcement.
